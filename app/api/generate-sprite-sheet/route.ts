const WALK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking to the right.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Right leg forward, left leg back - stride position
Frame 2 (top-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Left leg forward, right leg back - opposite stride
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition back

Each frame shows a different phase of the walking motion. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const JUMP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art jump animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is jumping.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Crouch/anticipation - character slightly crouched, knees bent, preparing to jump
Frame 2 (top-right): Rising - character in air, legs tucked up, arms up, ascending

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Apex/peak - character at highest point of jump, body stretched or tucked
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Landing - character landing, slight crouch to absorb impact

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const ATTACK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art attack animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is performing an attack that fits their design - could be a sword slash, magic spell, punch, kick, or energy blast depending on what suits the character best.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - character preparing to attack, pulling back weapon or gathering energy
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike or spell being unleashed

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Impact/peak - maximum extension of attack, weapon fully swung or spell at full power
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Recovery - returning to ready stance

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right. Make the attack visually dynamic and exciting.`;

const IDLE_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art idle/breathing animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is standing still but with subtle idle animation.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Neutral standing pose - relaxed stance
Frame 2 (top-right): Slight inhale - chest/body rises subtly, maybe slight arm movement

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Full breath - slight upward posture
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Exhale - returning to neutral, slight settle

Keep movements SUBTLE - this is a gentle breathing/idle loop, not dramatic motion. Character should look alive but relaxed.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const WALK_DOWN_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character walking DOWNWARD (toward the camera) in a top-down isometric RPG perspective (3/4 overhead view, like a classic top-down RPG).

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking toward the viewer (south/down).

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Left foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally
Frame 2 (top-right): Feet together, passing/transition pose

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Right foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Feet together, passing/transition back

We see the character's front/face. Top-down 3/4 view - we see the top of their head slightly. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames.`;

const WALK_UP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character walking UPWARD (away from the camera) in a top-down isometric RPG perspective (3/4 overhead view, like a classic top-down RPG).

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking away from the viewer (north/up).

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Left foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally — BACK VIEW
Frame 2 (top-right): Feet together, passing/transition pose — BACK VIEW

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Right foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally — BACK VIEW
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Feet together, passing/transition back — BACK VIEW

CRITICAL: ALL 4 frames must show the character from EXACTLY the same angle — their BACK, facing directly away from the camera. Do NOT rotate or twist the character between frames. The ONLY difference between frames should be the leg and arm positions for the walk cycle. The character's body angle, head direction, and facing must be IDENTICAL in every frame — always showing the back of the character. A simple back view with only legs alternating.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames.`;

const WALK_SIDE_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character WALKING TO THE RIGHT in a top-down isometric RPG perspective (3/4 overhead view, like a classic top-down RPG).

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is FACING RIGHT and WALKING RIGHT.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Right leg forward, left leg back - stride position, arms swinging
Frame 2 (top-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition pose

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Left leg forward, right leg back - opposite stride, arms swinging
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition back

We see the character's RIGHT-facing side profile from a top-down 3/4 overhead angle. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is facing away from the viewer (north/up) and performing the same attack.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - same motion as reference but seen from behind
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike unleashed upward/away from camera

Bottom row (frames 3-4):

I've also sent you a reference of the same character's front-facing attack. Use the EXACT SAME attack type, weapon, and visual effects - just show it from the side profile.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character faces RIGHT and performs the same attack.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - same motion as reference but from side view, facing right
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike unleashed to the right

Bottom row (frames 3-4):

IMPORTANT: Show the character's SIDE PROFILE facing RIGHT. Top-down 3/4 overhead angle. MUST use the same attack style as the reference image.
